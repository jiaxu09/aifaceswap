## FAQs About AI Face Swap Photography

**Does an AI headshot look obviously fake?**
Not with 2026 AI models! While older **ai face changer** apps often resulted in blurry edges or disconnected skin tones, our **replace face ai** utilizes semantic blending. The final image incorporates actual shadows from the room lighting in the base image directly onto your cheekbones and jawline, rendering a 100% photorealistic result. 

**Is a free AI face swap app safe for my personal photos?**
Privacy is our priority. At AIFaceSwap Space, we delete uploaded files securely from our GPU nodes right after your task completes. We do not harvest or train our base models on user data.

**Do I need an app download to swap faces ai?**
No. Finding an **ai face swap video free** or image platform that runs cleanly on the cloud is essential for data security and saving hard drive space. You can operate our platform entirely within Chrome, Safari, or Edge on both PC and Mobile.
